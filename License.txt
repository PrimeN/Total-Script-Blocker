Total Script Blocker is based on the old Chrome Extension "ScriptBlock". It gives you greater control over what javascript, iframes, and plugins runs in your browser to increase security and lower the CPU usage. It is useful to help mitigate attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and drive by downloads by minimizing the third party content run.

Most credits go to Eric Wong and Oliver von Schleusen for these great extension "NotScripts and ScriptBlock".
